# big-data-atlas

A Big Data team project I did in Year 12. 

We used the 13 TeV ATLAS Open Datasets, which provided us with raw data from real proton-proton collisions detected by ATLAS, as well as simulation samples. We tried to prove the existence of the Higgs Boson through the Higgs to gamma diphoton channel.
